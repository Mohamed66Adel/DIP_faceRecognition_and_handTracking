# Face Recognition and Verification AI Model

This project contains instructions that build, train, test, and deploy an AI model for face recognition and verification using TensorFlow and OpenCV.

## Dependencies

- tensorflow
- opencv-python
- matplotlib

## Dataset

- [Labeled Faces in the Wild](https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/#download). Choose ```All images as gzipped tar file``` from Download options, file size is 173 MB

- File name should be ```lfw.tgz``` and it should be placed in the same dir with ```setup.py``` file.

## Customization

You can customize the model, preprocessing, and training parameters by modifying the respective parts. Ensure you have the necessary understanding of TensorFlow and neural network architectures before making changes.
